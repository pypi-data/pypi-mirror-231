"""Storage of test results.

A Repository provides storage and indexing of results.

The AbstractRepository class defines the contract to which any Repository
implementation must adhere.

The stestr.repository.file module (see: :ref:`api_repository_file` is the usual
repository that will be used. The stestr.repository.memory module (see:
:ref:`api_repository_memory`) provides a memory only repository useful for
internal testing.

Repositories are identified by their URL, and new ones are made by calling
the initialize function in the appropriate repository module.
