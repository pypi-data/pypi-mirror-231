# partialdispatch

**This repository, which is to publish a python packages, is under development and currently undocumented.**

If you're interested in it, please get in touch, but but be aware this is very much "building in (semi)-public", until a proper documented version is up.

Drawbacks

* Currently only works on hash equality 

The argument `literal=True` must be passed when:

* Value is callable
* Value is a type
* Value is None
