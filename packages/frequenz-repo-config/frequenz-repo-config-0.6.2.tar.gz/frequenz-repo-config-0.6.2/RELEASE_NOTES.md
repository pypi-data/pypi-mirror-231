# Frequenz Repository Configuration Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

- Update the version used in the documentation.

### Cookiecutter template

- Update the generated version in dependencies.
- Exclude `benchmarks/` directory from source distribution.
- Use the native `navigation.indexes` extension from `mkdocs-material` instead of the `section-indexes` plugin.

  The plugin had some issues when failing to keep up to date.
