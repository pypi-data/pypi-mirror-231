## How make a dialog
The objective of this framework is to achieve it as simple task.
What do you need?
1. Create a new json file and create an object insiede
2. The attributes of this first object must be see as LABEL. Well-Know: "init" is the dialog entry pointer
3. Each Label, contain an attribute called "block" (this is an array)
4. Each array element, Is composed always by:
     - name character, as a string (case sensitive)
     - message
         - can be a string (that mean what the character said)
         - can be a menu (an object)
     - actions (if the message type is not a menu)
         - Those are composed by two words: ACTION ARGUMENT
         - The actions implemented are: move, alpha, restart, jmp
      
How to write a menu?
The menu is an object composed by two attributes: "menu" (with only a value implemented: regular) and "choice" an array of objects composed as follow: "txt" is a string containing the text and "jmp" the label where you want to jump after the selection of choice
