# cx
The ComputeX Python CLI lets you interact with ComputeX REST APIs and push images for your models to the ComputeX container registry.

## Installation

### Requirements

Run `pip install cx`.

## Command Line Interface
At any time, you can utilize the `--help` flag with any command or subcommand:

```shell

## Development
To test locally, run the following:

$ python -m cxcli.cli
```

### Publishing to PyPI
The process for publishing to PyPI works as follows:

- Pull down the `main` branch.
- Tag it with the current version as specified in `pyproject.toml`.
- Push that tag to the repo, which...
- Triggers a GitHub Action workflow (`pypi.yml`) that pushes it to PyPI.

This can all be done simply by running the following `make` command:

```shell
make pypi-publish 
```

Assuming you have the ability to push a tag to the repo, you'll be able to publish to PyPI.

**WARNING:** if you do not specify a new version in `pyproject.toml`, the GHA workflow will fail due to an existing package being on PyPI.
