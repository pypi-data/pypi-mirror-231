Quick installation guide
========================

Welcome to the installation guide. Before you can use Socon you will
need to install it on your computer. Be sure to check if you have python
installed with the correct version which should be ``>= 3.9``.

Install Python
==============

Get the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or with
your operating system's package manager.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from your shell;
you should see something like::

    Python 3.x.y
    ...
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

Install Socon
=============

Installing an official release
------------------------------

You can install an official release using ``pip``. Pip is the package manager
of python. It is used to install/update packages in your environment.

.. note::

   Using ``pip`` is the recommended way to install Socon.

#. Install `pip`_. Pip Usually comes with python and you can check it is
   already installed by typing ``python -m pip --version``. If you get
   an error, you can install it using the `standalone pip installer`_.

#. Create a virtual environment. You can get more information :doc:`here </intro/environment>`.
   For a quick reminder, a virtual environment provides isolated Python environments,
   which are more practical than installing packages systemwide.

#. After you created your virtual environment, enter the command:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ python -m pip install socon

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/
.. _standalone pip installer: https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/

Installing the development version
----------------------------------

Before installing the development version you need to check that you have `Git`_
installed and that you can run its commands from a shell.
(Enter ``git help`` at a shell prompt to test this.)

#. Clone Socon like so:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone https://github.com/socon-dev/socon.git

   This will create a directory ``socon`` in your current directory.

#. Make sure to install Socon in a virtual environment. It's not
   mandatory but it will keep your system environment clean. If you don't know
   how to do this, read: :doc:`Development environment </intro/environment>`

#. After setting up and activating the virtual environment, ``cd`` into the socon
   directory and:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ python -m pip install -e .

.. note::

   ``pip install -e``, install a project in editable mode (i.e. setuptools "develop mode")
   from a local project path or a VCS url.

Run ``git pull`` when you want to update your code. This command will fetch
and update your code with the latest changes.
