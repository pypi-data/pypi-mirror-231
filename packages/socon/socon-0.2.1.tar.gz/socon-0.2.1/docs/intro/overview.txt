Socon Overview
==============

Why Socon?
==========

The idea behind the framework is to help people and/or organizations to develop
their own fast and reliable framework for their different projects. We often
spend too much time creating scripts for a single project. Or spend too much time
trying to create generic scripts for several projects. Usually, this ends up
in hundreds of scripts and is very time-consuming.

Socon has been designed to simplify all that. Socon works with commands.
Socon will let you define common commands that can be shared across projects.
Each project can either write their own commands, or override a common command
to change its behavior by adding or removing functionalities.

Socon will also let you develop your own managers and hooks to empower your framework.
You are also free to develop your own plugins to share across your company,
with friends or with the world.

For who?
========

For people or organizations who need to develop common scripts for different
projects that share common or specific configurations.

How is Socon licensed?
=======================

Socon is distributed under the `3-clause BSD license`. This is an open source
license granting broad permissions to modify and redistribute Socon.

Why does Socon include Django and Pytest license files?
-------------------------------------------------------

Django
~~~~~~

I have worked quite a bit with `Django`_. I really liked the way they designed
the command module. The fact that you can define your own command for an
application is really interesting. I also liked the way they are registering
model, application configuration and general settings. This inspired
me to start creating Socon.

In Socon, I've modified a lot of their work which is why it might not be
recognizable. But as the saying goes, one must give to Caesar what is Caesar's'.

Pytest
~~~~~~

I also had the chance to work a lot with `Pytest`_. I really liked the way
they were interacting with the terminal. So the ``socon.utils.terminal`` module is
mostly their work, I've only added a couple of functions.
