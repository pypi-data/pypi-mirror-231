Changelog
=========

Versions follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ (``<major>.<minor>.<patch>``).

Right now Socon is at its premise. For that reason, there might be backward
incompatibility between two minors. If that is the case we will
still notice in the **Deprecations** section of the releases.

Later on, backward incompatibility (breaking) changes will only be
introduced in major versions with advance notice in the **Deprecations**
section of releases.

.. note::

    You can retrieve all deprecations :doc:`here </internals/deprecations>`

Socon 0.2.1
===========

Bug Fixes:
----------

* `#42 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/42>`_: Fixed by saving the subcommand and calling
  the right method to set the config attribute.

Socon 0.2.0
===========

Breaking Changes
----------------

* `#13 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/13>`_: As Socon is still as it's premise, we allow breaking changes
  between two MINORS. The following needs to be adapted if you were using Socon 0.1.x.

  To get a manager you now need to use ``managers.get_manager`` instead of ``BaseManager.get_manager``.
  The ``managers`` instance is accessible via ``socon.core.manager import managers``.

Features
--------

* `#28 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/28>`_: Added a new type of command called SubclassCommand. This type of command allow you to define multiple commands under one command.

* `#26 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/26>`_: The terminal.sep method now have a parameter to specify if you want to add a newline before, after or at both location (before and after)

* `#11 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/11>`_: Add a call_command(...) method to call a command internally.

* `#9 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/9>`_: Add a function to style the terminal output. This function was also implemented in the TerminalWriter.
  This way you can directly pass the markup you want to any TerminalWriter methods.

* `#6 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/6>`_: Add a new admin command called `createcommand`.
  This command automatically create a ProjectCommand or a BaseCommand in the common space or the specified project.

Bug Fixes:
----------

* `#37 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/37>`_: Fixed by calling parse_args of the called command

* `#32 <https://github.com/socon-dev/socon/issues/32>`_: Fixed by adding \n (newline) to the CommandError exception handler
