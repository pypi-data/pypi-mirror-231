EmberMaker
==========

Purpose
-------
EmberMaker is a cientific graphic library aimed at (re)producing "burning ember" diagrams 
of the style used in IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) reports.

EmberMaker was formerly a part of the EmberFactory project. It is now a separated project, which provides an API for
drawing burning ember and related diagrams. Future versions of the EmberFactory (starting at 2.0) will likely use the
EmberMaker API, limiting themselves to the web interface.
