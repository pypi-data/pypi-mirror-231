## Overview

***THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS RESEARCH CODE AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR PRODUCTION USE***

This package contains research code that can perform AI comprehension of trade
confirmations, model source code, and model documentation for the purposes of
model governance.

The objective is to support the following use cases:

- Validation of trade capture using LLM comprehension of trade confirmations
- Validation of model documentation using LLM comprehension of source code
- Validation of source code, identifying bugs and deviations from the approved methodology
- LLM generation of model documentation and release note drafts
