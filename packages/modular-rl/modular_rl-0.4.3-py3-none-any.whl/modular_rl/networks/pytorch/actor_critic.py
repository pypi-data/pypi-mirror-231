        This code defines a class ActorCriticNetwork that implements an actor-critic network using PyTorch.
        The actor-critic algorithm is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to learn how to maximize rewards in an environment by having an agent interact with the environment.
        This network takes as input the state and action dimensions, and the number of neurons in the hidden layers of both the actor and critic networks.
        It then predicts state-value and action-value for the given input.

        :param state_dim: (int) The dimensionality of the state space.
        :param action_dim: (int) The dimensionality of the action space.
        :param hidden_size: (int) The number of neurons in the hidden layers of both the actor and critic networks.
