PolicyNetwork is a neural network that takes in the current state of the environment as input and outputs a probability distribution over the available actions. 
The purpose of this network is to determine the best action to take in the current state.

ValueNetwork, on the other hand, 
is a neural network that takes in the current state of the environment as input and outputs a value that represents the expected future reward that can be obtained from that state. 
The purpose of this network is to estimate the value of a given state so that the agent can make decisions that lead to the most reward in the long term.

Both networks are important components of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, 
which is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm used for training agents to perform tasks in an environment.
