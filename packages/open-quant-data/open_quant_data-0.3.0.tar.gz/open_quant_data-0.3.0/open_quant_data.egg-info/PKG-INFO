# OPEN-QUANT-DATA

## Introduction
This is open source quant framework for local dataset generation
, third-party dataset api analysis, and quant data statistics

## Features
### Local Dataset
This feature need support from `open-quant-spider`, by
reading the data recording by `open-quant-spider` from 
Mysql or Redis. The framework export the dataset as csv 
files
### ThirdParty Dataset
Sometimes we may have insufficient data from local recording, 
so we plan to support third-party data sources. Currently, 
we support `Akshare` and `Xtquant + MiniQMT`, which includes
stock, bond, etf, in-market fund history data with multi formats.
### Statistics
The core statistics module's aim is to do factor statistics and
dataset utils.
