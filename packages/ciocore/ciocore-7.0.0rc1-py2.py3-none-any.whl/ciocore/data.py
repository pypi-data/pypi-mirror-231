    Provides projects, instance types, and software package data.

    If data has been fetched already, then return it, otherwise make requests to fetch it.
    The user may have to authentiicate.

    The set of instance types and software are each potentially pruned to match the available
    platforms represented by the other. If the instance types come from an orchestrator that
    provides both windows and linux machines, and the software product(s) are available on both
    platforms, then no pruning occurs. However, if there are no windows machines, then any windows
    software is removed from the package tree. Likewise, if a product is chosen that only runs on
    Windows, then Linux instance types will be culled from the list of available hardware.

    Keyword Arguments:

    * **`force`** -- If `True`, then fetch fresh data -- Defaults to `False`.
    
    Raises:

    * **`ValueError`** -- Module was not initialized with the [init()](#init) method.

    Returns:

    * A dictionary with 3 keys: `projects`, `instance_types`, `software`.

    * `projects` is a list of project names for the authenticated account.
    * `instance_types` is an instace of HardwareSet, from which you can get the data in various forms.
    * `software` is a [PackageTree](/developer/ciocore/package_tree) object containing either all
      software available at conductor, or a subset according to the product specified on
      initialization.
