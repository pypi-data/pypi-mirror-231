``sphinxcontrib-hdl-diagrams`` replaces ``sphinxcontrib-verilog-diagrams``
==========================================================================

sphinxcontrib-verilog-diagrams was renamed to
`sphinxcontrib-hdl-diagrams <https://github.com/SymbiFlow/sphinxcontrib-hdl-diagrams>`_
as it now supports more langauges than just verilog!

This stub module remains for backwards compatibility, but you should update to
using the new name.
