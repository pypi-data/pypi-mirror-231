============================================================

## Build and Update Package

```
make upload version=a.b.c
```

## Install This Package

```
pip install xalgorithm
```

## List of Implementations

| Decorator   | Usage |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `tag_me`    | Tag each function with a label and access the function using that label |
| `ctrl_c`    | Ask the user for confirmation to exit the program |
| `record_it` | Measure either the execution time or the execution count of a function |


| Array Algorithm  | Definition |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| :white_large_square: Sliding Window   |  |
| :white_check_mark: HuaRongDao  | Solve a puzzle where the goal is to start from initial state and end in final state |

All updates are tracked in [this file](./CHANGELOG.md). 


## Credits


To better prepare myself for the challenges of algorithmic problems, I have included code from [Open Data Structures](https://opendatastructures.org/). I will probably to rewrite some functions to make them compatible with my project as I continue to read this book. I owe huge gratitude for their work in jumping start my learning journey.
