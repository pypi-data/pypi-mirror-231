# HallPy_Teach

### Get Started
> pip install hallpy_teach

## Description
This package uses PyVISA to control and read instruments (power supplies, multimeters etc.) to run experiments in the Physics Honours Laboratory, initially for Hall Effect, although control of Curie Weiss law is also envisaged. This automates the data acquisition and allows easy recording of many data points in patterns or intervals defined by the user, and produces data files containing the results in numpy arrays, suitable for plotting and data analysis.

## Guide to push updates to the package
- Make your changes on a different branch 
- Create a [New Pull Request](https://github.com/maclariz/HallPy_Teach/compare) which merging your branch to main.
  - On the pull request you will be able to see if the workflow is able to build the package
- If the workflow is successfull on the Pull Request page, feel free to merge to `main` and then create a release on the [Release Page](https://github.com/maclariz/HallPy_Teach/releases)
  - Make sure you add a NEW tag by clicking on the choose tag button and adding a new tag. If you chose an older tag the package will build but not the workflow will fail when github tries to upload the package to Pypi.
