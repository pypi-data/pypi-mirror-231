    """Class representing the relations of a concept with other concepts.

    Concepts can be composites, meaning they consists of subconcepts (called constituent concepts). For example, a noun
    concept may have a singular and plural form. These forms are represented as constituent concepts of the parent
    concept. The parent and constituent attributes keep track of these relations.

    Another relation type that may exist between concepts is roots. Compound concepts such as 'blackboard' contain two
    roots, 'black' and 'board'. The concept for the compound concept refers to its roots with the roots attribute. The
    roots relation can also be used for sentences, in which case the individual words of a sentence are the roots.

    The antonym relation is used to capture opposites. For example 'bad' has 'good' as antonym and 'good' has 'bad'
    as antonym.

    The answer relation is used to specify possible answers to questions. Using the answer relation it is possible to
    specify that, for example, 'Do you like ice cream?' has the yes and no concepts as possible answers.

    NOTE: This class keeps track of the related concepts using their concept identifier (ConceptId) and only when
    the client asks for a concept is the concept instance looked up in the concept registry (Concept.instances). This
    prevents the need for a second pass after instantiating concepts from the topic files to create the relations.
