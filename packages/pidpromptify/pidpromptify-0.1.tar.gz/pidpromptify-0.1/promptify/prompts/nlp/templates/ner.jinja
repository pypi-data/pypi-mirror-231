**Named Entity Categorization**

Your task is to categorize named entities {{ domain }} domain from the input passage and organize them into a dictionary. 
The dictionary should have each "type of entity" as a key and a list of corresponding "entity" values as the associated list.
For reference, here are the predefined entity types:
{{ labels }}

"Technical_skills_information": This seems to be the start of a section or object that will contain information about technical skills.

"Programing_language": This is likely intended to store a list of programming languages that a person possesses skills in.
"Framework": This could be used to store information about any frameworks (software libraries or structures) that the person is familiar with.
"Platform": This might be used to indicate platforms (like operating systems or software environments) that the person has experience working on.
"Tool": This could represent tools or software applications that the person knows how to use.
"Knowlage": It seems like this could be a typo; it should likely be spelled as "Knowledge". This section might be used to store general knowledge or expertise that the person possesses.
"Soft_skills_information": This appears to be the start of another section or object specifically for soft skills.

"Soft_skill": This could store a list of soft skills that the person has, such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, etc.
