"""hashcache - a decorator for persistent, file/hash-based cache

I found some features of joblib were unsuitable for how I want to use a cache.

1. The "file" Python things the function is in is used to save the results in
joblib, which leads to repeated runs if you run the same code in Python,
notebook or stdin, and means the cache is not portable to other machines, and
maybe not even in time since temp directories and kernel parameters are
involved. I could not figure out how to change those in joblib.

2. joblib uses the function source code in the hash, so inconsequential changes
like whitespace, docstrings and comments change the hash.

This library aims to provide a simpler version of what I wish joblib did for me.

Results are cached based on a hash of the function name, argnames, bytecode, arg
values and kwarg values. I use joblib.hash for this. This means any two
functions with the same bytecode, even if they have different names,

The cache location is set as a function attribute:

    hashcache.cachedir = './cache'

Caveats:

1. hash-based approaches are fragile. If the function bytecode changes, the hash
will change. That means the cache may not work across Python versions, or if
some kind of optimization is used, etc.

There is no utility for pruning the cache. You can simply delete the directory,
or create a new one.

You can use hashcache.dryrun to avoid reading/writing and just return the cache.
Here is a way to delete a cache entry.

    hashcache.dryrun = True

    h = f(22)

    if os.path.exists(h): os.unlink(h)

This is alpha, proof of concept code. Test it a lot for your use case.
