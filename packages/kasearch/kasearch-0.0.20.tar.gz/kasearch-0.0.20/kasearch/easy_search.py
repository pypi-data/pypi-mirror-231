    Parameters
    ----------
    query : str
        Antibody sequence to search with
    keep_best_n : int
        Number of closest matches to return (default is 10)
    database_path : str
        Path to processed database to search against (default is oasdb-small)
    allowed_chain : str
        Which chain to search against (default is Any, options are Any, Heavy or Light)
    allowed_species : str
        Which species to search against (default is Any, options depend on database searched but often include Human and Mouse)
    regions : list
        List of regions to search. Only the first will be used (default is [whole])
    length_matched : list
        A flag for whether the identity will only be calculated between regions of identical length (default is [False])
    n_jobs : int
        Number of threads used (default is 1)

    Returns
    -------
    pandas dataframe
        A pandas dataframe with the keep_best_n closest sequences, and their meta data, to the query
