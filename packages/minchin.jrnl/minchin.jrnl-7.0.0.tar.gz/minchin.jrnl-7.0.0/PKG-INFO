Github.*

`minchin.jrnl` is a simple journal application for the command line.

You can use it to easily create, search, and view journal entries. Journals are
stored as human-readable plain text, and can also be encrypted using  [AES
encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard).

## In a Nutshell

To make a new entry, just enter

``` sh
jrnl yesterday: Called in sick. Used the time to clean the house and write my
book.
```

`yesterday:` is interpreted by `minchin.jrnl` as a timestamp. Everything until
the first sentence ending (either `.`, `?`, or `!`) is interpreted as the
title, and the rest as the body. In your journal file, the result will look
like this:

    [2012-03-29 09:00] Called in sick.
    Used the time to clean the house and write my book.

If you just call `jrnl`, you will be prompted to compose your entry - but you
can also configure *minchin.jrnl* to use your external editor.
