# Niquests

**Niquests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library. It is a drop-in replacement for **Requests** that is no longer under
feature freeze.
We will support and maintain v2.x.y that only ships with possible minor breaking changes. All breaking changes are issued in the v3.x that should be available as a pre-release on PyPI.

Why did we pursue this? We don't have to reinvent the wheel all over again, HTTP client **Requests** is well established and
really plaisant in its usage. We believe that **Requests** have the most inclusive, and developer friendly interfaces. We
intend to keep it that way.

```python
>>> import niquests
>>> r = niquests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
'{"authenticated": true, ...'
>>> r.json()
{'authenticated': True, ...}
```

Niquests allows you to send HTTP requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!

Niquests is one of the least downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around `100+ download / week`— according to GitHub, Niquests is currently depended upon by `1+` repositories. But, that may change..! Starting with you.
