## What is this?
This package includes lexers for JSX and TSX files for Pygment.
Pull requests are requested, and the code is released under the MIT License. We make no warranties this thing works, just doing our best.

## To use
Either:
`pip install pygments-tsx`

or add us to your requirements wherever they may be these days. (Looking at you, SetupTools, Poetry, PyPi... get it together.)

## Acknowledgments
This includes [Flavio Curella](https://github.com/fcurella)'s awesome package [JSX Lexer](https://github.com/fcurella/jsx-lexer), and includes the ideas and some code from [Igor Hatarist](https://github.com/hatarist)'s stab at this same problem [pygments-tsx](https://github.com/hatarist/pygments-tsx). Flaws were introduced by StartupOS, good stuff came from them.

There's also a hack in here for forcing pygments to accept classes programatically. That was based on discussions in this [thread](https://github.com/pygments/pygments/issues/1096), and specifically suggestions from [Vincent Bernat](https://github.com/vincentbernat) and [Jean Abou-Samra](https://github.com/jeanas)
