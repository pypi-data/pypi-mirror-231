* **Security:** Updated Pillow to 10.0.1.
* Added support for double puppeting with arbitrary `as_token`s.
  See [docs](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/double-puppeting.html#appservice-method-new) for more info.
* Added support for sending captions with [MSC2530].
* Fixed profile info not being visible in community group chats.

# v0.5.0 (2023-05-31)

* Added config option to disable bridging `m.notice` messages
  (thanks to [@jzapataikono] in [#280]).
* Added options to automatically ratchet/delete megolm sessions to minimize
  access to old messages.
* Added option to not set room name/avatar even in encrypted rooms.
* Added option to disable reply fallbacks entirely.
* Added notice message when a call is received on Messenger.
* Redid backfill system to support MSC2716.
  * Note that using Synapse's MSC2716 implementation is not recommended, and
    the bridge can still backfill messages without MSC2716.
* Implemented appservice pinging using MSC2659.
* Possibly improved MQTT connection handling.
* Fixed bridging profile pictures for Instagram users.
* Fixed MQTT connection failing in certain cases when Facebook returned weird
  data in the chat list.

# v0.4.1 (2022-11-15)

* Improved unsupported message fallbacks and added support for more message
  types from Facebook.
  * Powerup messages, descriptions in story attachments, facebook pay messages
    and group join links among other things should be bridged now.
* Added support for dynamically fetching a proxy URL.
* Added option to bypass startup script in docker image.

# v0.4.0 (2022-04-06)

* Dropped Python 3.7 support.
* Added optional support for bridging presence from Facebook to Matrix
  (thanks to [@JakuJ] in [#189]).
* Added option to not resync chats on startup and instead ask the server to
  just send missed messages.
* Added option to use [MSC2246] async media uploads.
* Changed some fields to stop the user from showing up as online on Facebook
  all the time.
* Changed incoming message handling to preserve order from Facebook to Matrix.
* Fixed calculating mention offsets (mentioning users in messages with
  complicated unicode characters like emojis).
  * This will break message rendering that involves mentions and emojis in the
    Messenger web app, but it works everywhere else. The issue on web happens
    even with messages sent from the official apps.
* Fixed bridging reactions from Facebook in certain cases.
* Fixed bridging files from Matrix with non-ascii names.

* (Re-)Added support for using SQLite as the bridge database.
* Added option to not use `http_proxy` env var for downloading files from Facebook CDN.

  if it errors more than once within 2 minutes.

# v0.3.0 (2021-05-02)

### Removed
* Removed Alembic. Database schema upgrades are handled automatically at
  startup as of v0.2.0. If upgrading from an older version, upgrade to v0.2.0
  first using the [upgrade instructions](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/python/facebook/upgrading-to-v0.2.0.html).

* Fixed bridging audio messages and other things containing 32-bit floats.

* Fixed error if bridge bot doesn't have permission to redact password when logging in.
