TSCoDe is a systematical conformational embedder for small molecules. It helps computational chemists build transition states and binding poses precisely in an automated way. It is thought as a tool to explore complex multimolecular conformational space fast and systematically, and yield a series of starting points for higher-level calculations.

Since its inclusion of many subroutines and functionality, it also serves as a computational toolbox
to automate various routine tasks, via either MM, semiempirical or DFT methods.

## :toolbox: Dependencies
TSCoDe is written in pure Python. It leverages the Numpy and Numba libraries to perform the linear algebra required to translate and rotate molecules and the [ASE](https://github.com/rosswhitfield/ase) environment to perform a set of structure manipulations. It supports various external calculators (at least one required):

-  MOPAC2016
-  ORCA (>=4.2)
-  Gaussian (>=9)
-  XTB (>=6.3)
-  Openbabel (3.1.0)
