A Python signal processing package for computing spectral- and time-domain
interactions using the bispectrum.

This package provides the tools for computing phase-amplitude coupling, time
delay estimation, and waveshape features using the bispectrum and bicoherence.
Additional tools for computing amplitude-amplitude coupling, phase-phase
coupling, and spatio-spectral filters are also provided.

Parallel processing and `Numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ optimisation are
implemented to reduce computation times. There is a minor reliance on the
`MNE <https://mne.tools/stable/index.html>`_ signal processing toolbox.
