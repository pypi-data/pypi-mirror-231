# Translation and Speech Recognition

This project uses the Google Translate API and the SpeechRecognition library to perform translations and recognize speech. Below are the functions implemented in this project:

## `listen()`

This function listens to audio input from a microphone and recognizes the speech in the input. It returns the recognized text in Hindi.

## `TranslationHinEng(Text)`

This function takes a text input in Hindi and translates it into English using the Google Translate API. It returns the translated text in English.

## `MiceExicution()`

This function combines the `listen()` and `TranslationHinEng()` functions to listen to audio input, recognize speech, and then translate it into English. It returns the translated text.

## Usage

To use these functions, you can call `MiceExicution()`, which will listen to your speech, translate it, and return the translated text.

```python
translated_text = MiceExicution()
print(f"Translated Text: {translated_text}")
```
