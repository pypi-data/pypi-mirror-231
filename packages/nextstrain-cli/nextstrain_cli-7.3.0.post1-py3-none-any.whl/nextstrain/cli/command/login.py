"""
Log into Nextstrain.org and save credentials for later use.

The first time you log in, you'll be prompted for your Nextstrain.org username
and password.  After that, locally-saved authentication tokens will be used and
automatically renewed as needed when you run other `nextstrain` commands
requiring log in.  You can also re-run this `nextstrain login` command to force
renewal if you want.  You'll only be prompted for your username and password if
the locally-saved tokens are unable to be renewed or missing entirely.

If you log out of Nextstrain.org on other devices/clients (like your web
browser), you may be prompted to re-enter your username and password by this
command sooner than usual.

Your password itself is never saved locally.
