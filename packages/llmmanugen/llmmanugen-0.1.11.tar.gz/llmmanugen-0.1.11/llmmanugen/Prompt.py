"""
The Prompt class is designed to encapsulate directives, guidelines, and constraints for guiding a large language model's response.

Directives: These are the core instructions that guide the model's response. They can include various subcategories like questions, statements, instructions, creative requests, analytical questions, hypothetical scenarios, debates, dialogues, step-by-step, and more.

Guidelines: These shape the tone, structure, and context of the response. They can include aspects like role, style, format, context, audience awareness, cultural sensitivity, accessibility considerations, multimodal instructions, and more.

Constraints: These set limitations or boundaries for the response, including length constraints, content restrictions, time, ethics, language, accessibility, legal or regulatory, domain-specific, sensitivity, multimodal constraints, and more.

Example:
    guidelines = {
        'Style': 'Formal',
        'Format': 'Essay',
        'Audience Awareness': 'Academic Readers'
    }
    constraints = {
        'Length Constraints': '1000 words',
        'Content Restrictions': 'Exclude slang or colloquial language'
    }
