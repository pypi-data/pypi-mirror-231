FiscalSim US is an open source microsimulation model of the US federal and state household tax and benefit system. It is supported and maintained by [The Center for Growth and Opportunity at Utah State University (CGO)](https://www.thecgo.org/). Much of the original federal tax and benefit code and some of the state tax logic was developed by [PolicyEngine](https://policyengine.org/), with which CGO originally had a partnership. Their US model is at [https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-us).
