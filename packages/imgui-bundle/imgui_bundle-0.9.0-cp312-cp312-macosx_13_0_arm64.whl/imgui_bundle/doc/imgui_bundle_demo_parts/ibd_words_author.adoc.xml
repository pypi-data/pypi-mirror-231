<simpara><link xl:href="https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle">Dear ImGui Bundle</link> is a bundle for <link xl:href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGui</link>, including various powerful libraries from its ecosystem. It enables to easily create ImGui applications in C&#43;&#43; and Python, under Windows, macOS, and Linux. It is aimed at application developers, researchers, and beginner developers who want to quickly get started.</simpara>
</sidebar>
<simpara>Dear ImGui Bundle aims to make applications prototyping fast and easy, in a multiplatform / multi-tooling context. The intent is to reduce the time between an idea and a first GUI prototype down to almost zero.</simpara>
<simpara>It is well adapted for</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>developers and researchers who want to switch easily between and research and development environment by facilitating the port of research artifacts</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>beginners and developers who want to quickly develop an application without learning a GUI framework</simpara>

<title>Who is this project <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> for</title>
<simpara>You should prefer a more complete framework (such as Qt for example) if your intent is to build a fully fledged application, with support for internationalization, advanced styling, etc.</simpara>
<simpara>Also, the library makes no guarantee of ABI stability, and its API is opened to slight adaptations and breaking changes if they are found to make the overall usage better and/or safer.</simpara>

<simpara>Dear ImGui Bundle would not be possible without the work of the authors of "Dear ImGui", and especially <link xl:href="https://www.miracleworld.net/">Omar Cornut</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>It also includes a lot of other projects, and I&#8217;d like to thank their authors for their awesome work!</simpara>

<title>Alternatives</title>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://pyimgui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pyimgui</link> provides battle-tested comprehensive python bindings for ImGui. I worked with this project a lot, and contributed a bit to it. In the end, I had to develop a separate project, in order to be able to add auto-generated and auto-documented python modules.</simpara>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://dearpygui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Dear PyGui</link>  (<link xl:href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui">repository</link>) provides python bindings for ImGui with a lot of addons, and a more pythonesque API, which makes it perhaps more suited for Python only projects.</simpara>

<title>About the author</title>
<simpara>Dear ImGui Bundle is developed by Pascal Thomet. I am reachable on my <link xl:href="https://github.com/pthom">Github page</link>. I sometimes <link xl:href="http://code-ballads.net/">blog</link>. There is a <link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaJx_KrDECZPzttQ77Gv8DD7OAUwmtWUc">playlist</link> related to ImGui Bundle on YouTube.</simpara>
<simpara>I have a past in computer vision, and a lot of experience in the trenches between development and research teams; and I found ImGui to be a nice way to reduce the delay between a research prototype and its use in production code.</simpara>
<simpara>I also have an inclination for self documenting code, and the doc you are reading was a way to explore new ways to document projects.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_how_is_dear_imgui_bundle_developed">
<title>How is Dear ImGui Bundle developed</title>
<simpara>The development of the initial version of Dear ImGui Bundle took about one year at full time.</simpara>
<simpara>The bindings are auto-generated thanks to an advanced parser, so that they are easy to keep up to date. I&#8217;ll give more information about the bindings generator a bit later in 2023.</simpara>
<simpara>Please be tolerant if you find issues! Dear ImGui Bundle is developed for free, under a very permissive license, by one main author (and most of its API comes from external libraries).</simpara>
<simpara>If you need consulting about this library or about the bindings generator in the context of a commercial project, please contact me by email.</simpara>
<simpara>Contributions are welcome!</simpara>

<title>History</title>
<simpara>Three of my past projects gave me the idea to develop this library.</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://traineq.org/implot_demo/src/implot_demo.html">implot demo</link> which I developed in 2020.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara><link xl:href="https://github.com/pthom/imgui_datascience">imgui_datascience</link>, a python package I developed in 2018 for image analysis and debugging. Its successor is immvision.</simpara>

<simpara>Developments for Dear ImGui Bundle and its related automatic binding generator began in january 2022.</simpara>
