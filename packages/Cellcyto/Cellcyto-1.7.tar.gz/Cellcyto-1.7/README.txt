The project focuses on developing an algorithm for segmenting nuclei and cytoplasm in cells using a cell segmentation mask as input. The proposed method involves using post-processing techniques to locate the nucleus and cytoplasm. To evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation algorithm, the Per Object-based Evaluation of Segmentation Accuracy (POSEA) method has been integrated into the graphical user interface (GUI). POSEA (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283692)is a published approach for evaluating the performance of segmentation algorithms in the context of biomedical imaging, which employs a per object approach to compare segmentation results to ground truth images and calculate metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure. The integration of POSEA into the GUI provides a useful tool for researchers to validate and improve the accuracy of their segmentation algorithms in a standardized and reproducible manner.
