   [//]: # (   ```)

3. **Install Endstone**

   You have two options to install Endstone:

    - **Option A: Install from PyPI**

      Run the following command in your terminal to install Endstone from PyPI:

      ```bash
      pip install endstone
      ```

    - **Option B: Install locally**

      You can also clone the repository and install it locally. First, clone the repository:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/EndstoneMC/endstone.git
      ```

      Navigate into the `endstone` directory:
