# home-presence-tracker
The Home Presence Tracker is a program that utilizes Wi-Fi device presence and potentially other sensors to track who is "home." It leverages machine learning techniques to predict when someone will be home based on previous data. The goal is to provide a convenient way to make intelligent predictions about someoneâ€™s future arrival times.
