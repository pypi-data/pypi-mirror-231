 * Constructs a set of types from a shorthand string representation. In it,
 * each character represents one type. The supported characters are as follows:
 *
 *  - Q = qubit
 *  - B = assignable bit/boolean (measurement register)
 *  - b = bit/boolean
 *  - a = axis (x, y, or z)
 *  - i = integer
 *  - r = real
 *  - c = complex
 *  - u = complex matrix of size 4^n, where n is the number of qubits in
 *        the parameter list (automatically deduced)
 *  - s = (quoted) string
 *  - j = json
 *
 * In general, lowercase means the parameter is only read and can thus be a
 * constant, while uppercase means it is mutated.
 *
 * Note that complex matrices with different constraints and real matrices of
 * any kind cannot be specified this way. You'll have to construct and add
 * those manually.
