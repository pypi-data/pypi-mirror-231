 * Representation of an available instruction (also known as gate) in the
 * instruction set, without parameters bound to it (note that libqasm cannot
 * match instructions based on which qubits are used; you'll need to do that on
 * your own).
 *
 * A number of these can be registered into libqasm by the program or library
 * using it through \ref cqasm::analyzer::Analyzer::register_instruction(const instruction::Instruction&)
 * "register_instruction()", to inform libqasm of the supported instruction set.
 * For each instruction, libqasm needs to know its name, which parameters it
 * expects, and a few extra flags in order to be able to resolve the
 * instruction and check for errors in the cQASM file. The resolved instruction
 * type is part of the cqasm::semantic::Instruction node present in the
 * semantic tree returned through the parse result structure.
 *
 * Note that it is legal to have multiple instructions with the same name, as
 * long as they can be distinguished through their parameter types (i.e.
 * instructions can be overloaded).
 *
 * You can add any data you like to these through the
 * \ref cqasm::annotatable::Annotatable "Annotatable" interface
 * for your own bookkeeping, so you don't have to maintain an additional map
 * from this error model structure to your own internal structure if you're
 * okay with using this one.
