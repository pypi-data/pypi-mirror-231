📈 QuotexPy is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10 with **python >= 3.10, <= 3.11.**.
```bash

pip install -e .
```

### Import
```python
from quotexpy.new import Quotex
```

```python
from quotexpy.new import Quotex

client = Quotex(email="user@email.com", password="password", browser=True)
# if connect success return True or None 
# if connect fail return False or None 
client.debug_ws_enable = False
check_connect, message = client.connect()
print(check_connect, message)
```

```python

client = Quotex(email="user@email.com", password="password", browser=True)
client.debug_ws_enable = False

print(check_connect, message)
if check_connect:
    client.change_account("PRACTICE")
    amount = 30
    asset = "EURUSD_otc"  # "EURUSD_otc"
    direction = "call"
    duration = 10  # in seconds
    status, buy_info = client.buy(amount, asset, direction, duration)
    print(status, buy_info)
    print("Balance: ", client.get_balance())
    print("Exiting...")
client.close()
```
### ⚠️ Atention 
Because cloudfare blocks requests you should enable `browser=True` to avoid `HTTP 403` errors.
