description = Dynamic item set clustering UI tool: The goal of this package is to split datasets (e.g. words defined by several variables) into subsets that are as comparable as possible.
	The package takes a csv file as input and generates a defined number of matched sets for a given number of continuous and categorical variables. One of the categorical variables can be selected to be split absolutely even across sets.
