# 🦜🔗🔍 Tinylang

Make working with LLMs insanely simpler and easier than ever before.

## What is tinylang?
A hackable and simpler Langchain.

Langchain can be very cumbersome and annoying to work with. It's too big, complicated, and shoves premade prompts down your throat.

With tinylang, everything is intuitive and customizeable, following most of the Langchain API.


## Installation

```shell
pip install tinylang
```

## Usage

```
from tinychain.memory import ConversationMemory
from tinychain.llms import OpenAIChat
from tinychain.chains import LLMChain

memory = ConversationMemory(last_k=10)

chatGPT = OpenAIChat(OPENAI_API_KEY='')

chain = LLMChain(memory, chatGPT)

prompt = "Hello"
print(chain.run(prompt))
```


## Features

- 🧠 Conversation Memory. Keep all or some aspects of your conversation
- 🤖 OpenAI LLMs. It couldn't be easier to call the OpenAI API.
- 💻 Prompts. Simple and hackable.
