# Ninebot Scooter BLE Python client

Python client for interfacing with a Ninebot scooter using bluetooth low energy (BLE).

It is primarely using the BLE UART characteristic for communication with the scooter. It is also
using the new encrypted protocol using [miauth](https://github.com/dnandha/miauth) library. Old
scooter firmwares might therefore not work.

The projects primary objective is to support Home Assistant integration but will probably work for
more use-cases as well.

## Usage

Installation:

```
pip install ninebot-ble
```

A client for testing purposes are shipped:

```
# Dump all memory registers
ninebot-ble --all
```
