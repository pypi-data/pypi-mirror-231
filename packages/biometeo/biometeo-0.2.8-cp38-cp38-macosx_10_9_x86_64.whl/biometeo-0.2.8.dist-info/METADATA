Summary: This package is applied to calculate thermal indicators for human biometeorology. 
Requires-Dist: numpy (>=1.19.2)
Requires-Dist: Cython (>=0.29.28)

This package is applied to calculate thermal indicators for human biometeorology.
The available thermal indicators are Physiological Equivalent Temperature (PET), modified Physiological Equivalent Temperature (mPET), Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), Standard Effective Temperature* (SET*) and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) in this package.
An additional function named GlobalRadiation_Tmrt is appended in the package for applying G, N, and Omega to calculate Tmrt from part of original RayMan model code.
