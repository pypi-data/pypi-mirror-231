In an era inundated with data, unraveling the intricate connections between different data views is paramount. **CCA-Zoo** emerges as the definitive toolkit for this, offering an extensive suite of linear, kernel, and deep methods for canonical correlation analysis. 

Inspired by the simplicity and effectiveness of `scikit-learn` and `mvlearn`, CCA-Zoo offers a seamless experience with its `fit`/`transform`/`fit_transform` methods.
