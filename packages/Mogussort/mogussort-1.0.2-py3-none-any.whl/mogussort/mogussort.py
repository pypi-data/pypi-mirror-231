    """
    There are 2 (two, 2ðŸ“®) lists, `crew_in` and `crew_out`.

    - `crew_in` contains all crewmates at the start of the game.
    - `crew_out` is empty.

    The algorithm will vote out one random crewmate and put it in `crew_out` That crewmate is then removed from `crew_in`. Then, it checks if `crew_out` is correctly sorted (ascending).

    If it is correnct, it will continue to vote and populate `crew_out`.

    If the crewmates are not in the right order an ðŸ“®ImpostorðŸ“® (sus, baka) has been spotted. This means that the game is lost, and `crew_out` will be cleared, and `crew_in` will be reset to the original form.

    The algorithm will stop once all crewmates are in the right order.
