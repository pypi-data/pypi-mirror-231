These are the Python bindings for the PhiloLogic search engine.

This package is only useful for the TEI Parser which you can import for use
outside of PhiloLogic.

To get the full functionality of PhiloLogic, you need to install the search core
as well as the web components. See <a href="https://github.com/ARTFL-Project/PhiloLogic4">https://github.com/ARTFL-Project/PhiloLogic4</a>
