    """
    Performs tracking with Laplacian of the Gaussian blob detection rather than local maximum,
    as Trackpy does it. Laplacian of the Gaussian is a more expensive algorithm, taking longer
    to run (though this can be reduced by reducing n_radii), but offers automatic detection of
    the size of the found particles, allowing tracking of particles of heterogenous sizes.
    It is also better able to pick up particles that are very close to eachother, though it is
    still a difficult task. It is recommended to visually inspect tracking with both trackpy-like
    tracking and LoG tracking to choose the best approach and parameters for the experiment.
